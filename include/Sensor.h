/**
 * Sensor class
 * @brief The Sensor class describes a sensor of the type SensorType
 *
 * The design of the sensor-class is based on the design pattern 'strategy'.
 * In respect of this the sensor-class is the so called 'Context' within the Strategy-Pattern.
 *
 * The Sensor class provides access to different kinds of sensors, which are defined as implementations
 * of the interface SensorType.
 * By setSensorType() one can choose the type of the sensor one wants to access.
 * The function readSensor() returns the double value of the current sensor measurement
